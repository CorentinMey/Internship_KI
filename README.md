## Integration of histopathological image data and expression data from Spatial Transcriptomics to identify tissues within breast cancer sections

## Description
Analysis of Gene Expression Profiles in Histological Tissue Sections is a cornerstone in biological research and diagnostics. In this study, an innovative technique, spatial transcriptomics, is used to analyze gene expression profiles at a specific time and location within sections of cancerous breast tissue. The goal is to analyze and detect, using these data, the cancerous, benign, stromal, immune, and adipose tissues present in a breast tissue section. The data generated by spatial transcriptomics come in two forms: spatial gene expression data and histopathological image data, which provide information about tumor morphology. These data will be processed using Machine Learning tools with the aim of training a model capable of detecting the different tissue types, including cancerous ones. This work presents the performance of various models: models trained solely on spatial gene expression data, models trained solely on histopathological image data, and finally, models trained on combined spatial gene expression and histopathological image data. A differential expression analysis was also conducted to characterize expression profiles specific to each tissue type present in the breast sections.
